# password-validation

Write a Python program to check the validity of passwords input by users. 
Validation: 
 At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z]. 
 At least 1 number between [0-9]. 
 At least 1 character from [$#@]. 
 Minimum length 6 characters. 
 Maximum length 10 characters. 
Your code should prompt the user to create/input a new password. Make use of all 
functions and conditional statements that we have covered thus far. Please note that 
you are not allowed to use more than one function that we have not covered in our 
previous classes. 
Failure to adhere to the instructions, will result in your Program being penalised.
